            The rise of SMS scams — from fake promos
            to phishing schemes — threatens public trust in digital infrastructure
          </span>. Despite government and telecom crackdowns, 
          fraudulent texts continue to evolve, highlighting the need for smarter, data-driven solutions.

            <h2 class="pb-5 font-bold">Problem</h2>
            <p>
              SMS scams in the Philippines are widespread and constantly adapting, making it difficult for
              existing defenses to keep up. This undermines consumer trust in mobile communication and financial services.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="border-l-2 px-10">
            <h2 class="pb-5 font-bold">Solution</h2>
            <p>
              Our solution is to apply machine learning models using both classical and transformer to detect and analyze scam texts. By studying linguistic patterns unique to Philippine SMS, we aim to develop a robust detection system that enhances trust in mobile infrastructure and protects users from fraud.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <h2 class="font-bold">Background</h2>
        <p class="mt-6 text-lg text-white font-space-grotesk text-justify">
          The rapid growth of mobile communication in the Philippines has been accompanied by an alarming rise
          in spam and scam text messages. <span class="highlight">In 2024, over 6.1 million SMS scams were reported nationwide</span>, with the final quarter
          contributing almost one-third of incidents (Dela Cruz, 2025). Although the <span class="font-bold">Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT)</span>
          and the <span class="font-bold">National Telecommunications Commission (NTC)</span> have intensified crackdowns
          to block billions of fraudulent SMS and dismantle scam hubs, cybercriminals have continued to adapt,
          often using spoofing and phishing tactics that weaken consumer trust in mobile infrastructure (Salonga, 2024).
          <br>
          <br>
          Telecommunications companies have also scaled up defenses. In 2025, Globe Telecom launched the SMS Scam Shield, an in-app feature designed to automatically flag suspicious texts. <span class="highlight">Globe also reported blocking over 484 million scam and spam messages</span> in the first half of 2025 alone (Amojelar, 2025; Camus, 2025). These interventions highlight industry recognition of the scale of the problem, yet they also underscore the need for complementary, data-driven solutions that can generalize across new and evolving scam strategies.
          <br>
          <br>
          Globally, text-based fraud remains a pressing concern. The FBI recently issued warnings about “smishing” attacks targeting mobile users (Zilber, 2025), while researchers have reported the growing use of SMS “blasters” that enable mass scam campaigns (Wired, 2025). In the Philippines, recent law enforcement operations dismantled hubs employing hundreds in cybercrime activities (Associated Press, 2025). Against this, developing robust machine learning models for SMS spam and fraud detection is both timely and aligned with SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) and SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions) to strengthen trust in digital communication while addressing cybercrime.
